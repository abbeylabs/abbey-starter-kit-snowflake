# Abbey Starter Kit Snowflake

This example shows how to create a Grant Kit.
The example features requesting access to a [Snowflake Role Grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/role_grants)
from multiple reviewers, requiring only `one_of` the reviewers to approve the access.
